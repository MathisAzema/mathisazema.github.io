I am a first year PhD student, under the supervision of [Vincent Leclère](https://leclere.github.io/) ([CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/), Ecole des Ponts) and Wim Van Ackooij (EDF R&D). My research currently focuses on Distributionally Robust Optimization approaches for Unit Commitment problem.

Before that, I graduated from [Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) (X2020, top 5%) and got a master's degree from Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers ([MPRO](https://uma.ensta-paris.fr/mpro/)).
